2. Then run **initial_perspective_calibration.py** to find GSD 

Run **find_pixel.py**
1. Define image path
2. Set GSD (You may calculate the dedicated GSD from excel sheet or GSDcal.py)
3. Define working distance (unchanged by default) 
4. Run the program
5. Left click the mouse for the first point you want to measure
6. Right click the mouse for the second point you want to measure, the distance of two points will be shown on the image
